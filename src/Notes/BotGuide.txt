====================
==BEFORE YOU BEGIN==
====================
========
==NOTE==    You need to install the JDK(not the JRE).
========            http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html

-Make sure you have copied JIntellitype.dll and JIntellitype64.dll into your system32 folder. 
    You need these for global hotkeys to pause bot.
-Goto task manager. Goto view menu on top. Click Select Columns. Check the PID(Process Identifier) box. 

========
==NOTE==    You need to input Zezenia's PID into the bot every time you start Zezenia's client.
========
    
-You must have the newest CheatEngine installed to use this bot.
-You must have the cheattables zezenia.ct to use with cheatengine to use this bot.




--------------
--Begin Here--
--------------

1]Open Zezenia and JonBot2.

2]Configure your Zezenia client settings.
    Skin:Dark Stripes
    Use Double UI.
    Force new windows to the right
    Classic right click

3]Login into your bot character. 
    (If you log onto any other character, you have to repeat the following steps when you log back onto your bot character).

4]Arrange your client the following way.
    On your left side.
        Character status.
        Actions
        People
        Minimap
    On your right side.
        Inventory
        All following backpacks.

5]Open all your backpacks in the following order.
        main bp
        mana potion bp
        health potion bp
        arrow bp
                Food goes into the first slot of this backpack.
                (It doesn't matter if you are not a ranger. There must be some kind of 4th backpack opened here.)
        Loot backpacks bp
                (This is a backpack full of empty bps(or bags))
        GOLD BACKPACK
                (Open your first lootbackpack here, but do not close your previous backpack of loot backpacks)
        NON-GOLD ITEM BACKPACK
                (open your second lootbackpack here, but do not close previous backpacks.)

6]Start cheatengine 
    Attach to zezenia.exe and load the zezenia.ct addresses.
    Write down all the addresses into their appropriate fields on the addresses tab of the bot.
        All fields must be filled in.

7]Setup Healing
    Set the percentages at what you want.
    Enable(check) all potions and spells that you want to use.
    Hit start healing button.

========
==NOTE==    The PAUSE key pauses healing.
========

8]Save settings.
    This saves all boxes.
    If for any reason you close the bot at this point, without closing the client, you can reopen bot and it will autoload all previous values.

------------------------    
---CAVEBOT STEPS BELOW--
------------------------

9]Setup cavebot.
    Goto file and load cavebot script.
        Find your script and load it. It will auto-populate the scipt area of the cavebot tab.
        If you want to make your own, remember that you need to(preferably) walk in straight lines from point, to point.
    Hit start cavebot button.
        You now have 2 seconds to alt tab client before the bot begins processing the script and trying to target monsters.

========
==NOTE==    The INSERT key pauses the cavebot and targeting.
========

NOTES:
    If you close the Zezenia for any reason, you will redo steps 5-9. 
        Until java lets me auto-compute the base address of running applications, this is not fixable.


=====================================
==COMMON ISSUES AND HOW TO FIX THEM==
=====================================
JAR DOESNT RUN WHEN DOUBLE CLICKED. 
    Try to run the runme.bat file as administrator.
CAVEBOT ISNT MOVING ME ANYWHERE.
    You have to load the script before you press the start cavebot button.
CAVEBOT IS MOVING ME IN THE WRONG DIRECTIONS.
    You entered the wrong character x,y, or z, into the address tab.
    You might have entered the wrong PID on the healing tab.
